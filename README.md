3D Train Arrival At Station 🚂

Project Overview
This interactive 3D simulation recreates the dynamic experience of a train arriving at Mumbai Central Station using Three.js. The project combines realistic physics, environmental details, and multiple viewing perspectives to demonstrate advanced WebGL capabilities in a browser environment. The simulation features a complete train with animated wheels that gradually decelerates as it approaches the station signal, complete with platform elements, station architecture, and surrounding cityscape.

How It Works 🔧

System Architecture

Initialization Phase:
Loads required Three.js components and fonts
Sets up scene, camera, and renderer
Configures lighting and shadows

Scene Construction:
Creates track system with sleepers and rails
Builds station environment (platform, roof, benches)
Generates background cityscape
Assembles train model with multiple coaches

Animation Loop:
javascript:
function animate() {
    const delta = clock.getDelta();
    // Train movement logic
    if (trainMoving) {
        train.position.z += trainSpeed * delta;
        wheels.forEach(wheel => wheel.rotation.x += trainSpeed * delta);  
        // Deceleration near signal
        if (distanceToSignal < 10) {
            trainSpeed = Math.max(0.5, trainSpeed * 0.98);
        }
    }
    // Camera updates
    updateCamera();
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

User Interaction:
Camera buttons modify view mode
OrbitControls enabled in default view
Responsive design adapts to window resize

Key Algorithms
Train Deceleration:
Calculates distance to target position
Applies logarithmic deceleration curve
Maintains minimum speed threshold

Camera Interpolation:
Uses vector lerping for smooth transitions
Maintains proper lookAt targets
Handles view-specific positioning

Signal Animation:
Toggles emissive material properties
Synchronizes point light intensity
Uses setInterval for consistent blinking
This implementation showcases professional-grade 3D web development techniques while maintaining clean, readable code structure suitable for both learning and extension.
